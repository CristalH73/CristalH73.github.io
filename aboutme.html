		<!-- HOBBIES SECTION -->
		<h2 id = "hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
		<section class = "hobbies">
			<h3>Games</h3>
			<div class = "hobby">
				<p>Video games have been a part of my life since I was young. I think they're a great way
					to relax and enjoy being in a different world. My favorite genres are puzzle games, like
					Portal and The Nonary Games, and JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games), such as Final 
					Fantasy X-2, although I play a wide variety of games.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Music</h3>
			<div class = "hobby">
				<p>Music became enjoyable to me mainly because of video games. I found that the music chosen
					highly contributed to the overall feeling of the games and if it was good enough, it stayed
					with you after the game was over reminding you of the scenes associated to it. My playlist
					consists of a good amount of video game music.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Singing</h3>
			<div class = "hobby">
				<p>As I was moved by music, naturally singing followed. It allowed me to feel the
					emotions songs were trying to convey in a different manner. Singing has helped me to
					get in touch with my emotions and outwardly express it. I can't say I sing well though.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<div class = "hobby">
				<p>The song Simple and Clean from the game Kingdom Hearts led me to the Japanese singer Utada 
					Hikaru. From there, I stemmed into her other music and became interested in the Japanese
					language and culture. Later on down the road, I was introduced to the Korean boyband 
					BigBang and was pulled into the Korean language and culture as well. I have learned a 
					small amount of Japanese and Korean over the years by watching animes, dramas, listening
					to the music, and learning the lyrics.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Dancing</h3>
			<div class = "hobby">
				<p>Learning choreography has always been an outlet for me and a fun way to get some exercise.
				Over the course of years, I learned some choreography of Japanese girl groups and Korean
				girl and boy groups, as well as choreography I see on youtube from 1Million Studios and
				Kyle Hanagami.</p>
