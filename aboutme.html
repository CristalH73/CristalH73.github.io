      <h3>Games</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hobby">
          <p>
            Video games have been a part of my life since I was young. I think
            they're a great way to relax and enjoy being in a different world.
            My favorite genres are puzzle games, like Portal and The Nonary
            Games, and JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games), such as Final
            Fantasy X-2, although I play a wide variety of games.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hobby">
          <p>
            Music became enjoyable to me mainly because of video games. I found
            that the music chosen highly contributed to the overall feeling of
            the games and if it was good enough, it stayed with you after the
            game was over reminding you of the scenes associated to it. My
            playlist consists of a good amount of video game music.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Singing</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hobby">
          <p>
            As I was moved by music, naturally singing followed. It allowed me
            to feel the emotions songs were trying to convey in a different
            manner.
            <span class="emph">
              Singing has helped me to get in touch with my emotions and
              outwardly express it.
            </span>
            I can't say I sing well though.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hobby_design">
          <p class="korean">
            안녕하세요! <br />
            한국어 조금 알아요!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hobby language">
          <p>
            The song Simple and Clean from the game Kingdom Hearts led me to the
            Japanese singer Utada Hikaru. From there, I stemmed into her other
            music and became interested in the Japanese language and culture.
            Later on down the road, I was introduced to the Korean boyband
            BigBang and was pulled into the Korean language and culture as well.
            <span class="emph">
              I have learned a small amount of Japanese and Korean over the
              years
            </span>
            by watching animes, dramas, listening to the music, and learning the
            lyrics.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Dancing</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hobby">
          <p>
            Learning choreography has always been an outlet for me and a fun way
            to get some exercise. Over the course of years, I learned some
            choreography of Japanese girl groups and Korean girl and boy groups,
            as well as choreography I see on youtube from 1Million Studios and
            Kyle Hanagami.
